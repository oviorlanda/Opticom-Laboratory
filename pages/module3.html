                <p>This cutting-edge module introduces students to the latest developments and emerging technologies in optical communication. The course explores innovative applications of optical wireless communication, including Free Space Optics (FSO) and Visible Light Communication (VLC), which represent the future of high-speed wireless data transmission.</p>
                
                <p>Students will dive deep into research-oriented topics such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) optical communication systems, which are crucial for the development of autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. The module covers Underwater Visible Light Communication, an emerging technology for underwater data transmission that offers advantages over traditional acoustic methods in terms of speed and bandwidth.</p>
                
                <p>The curriculum explores hybrid systems combining Radio Frequency (RF) and Visible Light Communication, demonstrating how these complementary technologies can work together to provide robust, high-capacity wireless networks. Special attention is given to optical communication in challenging environments, such as Underground Mining VLC, where traditional wireless technologies face significant limitations due to confined spaces and harsh conditions.</p>
                
                <p>Through research-oriented laboratory activities and projects, students will gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art optical communication equipment and experimental setups. They will learn to design, implement, and evaluate novel optical communication systems, analyze performance metrics, and understand the trade-offs involved in different system configurations. This module prepares students for advanced research opportunities, graduate studies, or careers in the rapidly evolving field of optical communication technology development and innovation.</p>
