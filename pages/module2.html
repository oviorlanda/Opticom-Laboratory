                <p>This advanced module delves into the architecture and components of modern optical transmission systems. Students will explore the complete ecosystem of optical communication networks, from transmission equipment to receiving devices, understanding how these components work together to enable high-speed data transmission over vast distances.</p>
                
                <p>The curriculum covers essential technologies including Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), which enables multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over a single fiber by using different wavelengths of light. Students will study various optical sources such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes, understanding their characteristics, advantages, and applications in different network scenarios.</p>
                
                <p>A significant portion of the module focuses on optical receivers and photodetectors, explaining how optical signals are converted back into electrical signals. Students will learn about different types of photodetectors, their sensitivity, response times, and noise characteristics. The module also covers optical amplification technologies, including Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) and Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA), which are crucial for long-distance optical communication.</p>
                
                <p>Through comprehensive laboratory sessions, students will conduct experiments with optical transmitters and receivers, analyze system performance metrics such as bit error rate and signal-to-noise ratio, and explore various modulation techniques including intensity modulation and phase modulation. This practical experience bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world implementation, preparing students for careers in telecommunications network design, installation, and maintenance.</p>
